### Setup

You'll need docker to get going. The easiest way is to download the Docker application from https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download. Select the Mac or Windows download options.

After you install docker, you'll need to launch it. It will run in the background, and have a nice little icon (mac users, in the upper right task bar, windows users, in the lower right).

### Running

To run this application, open the directory in your shell, and run `docker-compose up`. This will download the necessary docker images, and then run the server.
